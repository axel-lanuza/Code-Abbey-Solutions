INSTRUCTIONS:
When program deals with numbers which have fraction part we sometimes want to round such values to whole integer. We'll need this for programming some later problems (to make answers more uniform, for example), so let us have the following dedicated exercise to learn this trick.

There are several pairs of numbers. For each pair you are to divide first by second and return the result, rounded to nearest integer.

In cases, when result contains exactly 0.5 as a fraction part, value should be rounded up (i.e. to next integer greater than given one). Note that for negative values "greater" means "closer to zero". Refer to the Wikipedia page on Rounding for more thorough explanations.

In any further problems, when rounding is mentioned - just the same rounding algorithm is supposed (unless other is explicitly specified).

Example:

data:
3
12 8
11 -3
400 5

result:
2 -4 80

//change a string of numbers to an array of strings of numbers
var arr = inputStr.split(" "); //splits the string at each space, and places the results into an array
   
//convert strings to integers
for (var i=0, j=arr.length; i<j; i++) {
        arr[i] = parseInt(arr[i], 10); //parseInt(string, base) converts the given string into an integer of the given base
    };

//chop first two elements from the array, place them into new array and divide position 0 by position 1
for (var counter = 0, arr2 = []; counter<14; counter++) {
      var removed = arr.splice(0, 2); //2.1 remove first two elements from the array
      var divide = removed[0]/removed[1];
      var round = Math.round(divide);
      arr2.push(round);
      while (removed.length>0) { //if there are elements in the temporary array
          removed.pop(); //empty the temporary array
      }; //console.log(arr2); just checking my work
  };

//convert arr2 to an acceptable format for the task instructions
var solution = arr2.join(" "); //.join() converts array2 back into a string, with the array's elements separated by whitespace
    alert(solution);
